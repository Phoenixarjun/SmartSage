## Features

- **Document Uploads**: Upload documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats for AI processing.
- **URL Processing**: Enter a URL to process the content available at the given web address.
- **Conversational Interface**: Ask AI questions about the processed documents or content and get meaningful answers.
- **Personalized Conversations**: Keep track of your conversation history and interact with the AI.
- **Customizable**: Add your Gemini API key for enhanced capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)
- Gemini API Key (required for document processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
````bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smartsage.git
````

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd smartsage
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Youâ€™ll need an API key for processing documents. Obtain it from Gemini and add it to your environment or use it directly in the app.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the App:**

   * Upload documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format via the sidebar.
   * Alternatively, input a URL to load content directly from a webpage.
   * Enter your Gemini API Key for document processing.
   * Type questions in the chatbox to query the AI about the uploaded or processed content.
   * The app will provide real-time responses based on the processed documents.

## Interface

The user interface is divided into two main sections:

* **Document Processing** (Sidebar):

  * Upload documents or provide URLs.
  * Enter your Gemini API key for document analysis.
  * Process documents with a click of a button.

* **Conversational Chat** (Main Area):

  * Chat interface for asking questions related to the processed documents.
  * Displays conversation history with AI and user messages.


## API Integration
